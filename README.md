Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative!

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

Overall customer satisfaction
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered.

# Task 2: Customer Retention
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
The Retentions Manager has provided some information in the resources.
